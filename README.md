# A project for my Bachelor's Degree
## Analyzing short texts (tweets, reddit and facebook comments and similar) and determining the sentiment of the text in slovenian, croatian, and serbian lamguage.

- The raw text is sent to the python program, where a croatian lemmatizer is, then the output is used in the java program to calculate the sentimentality of the text.
- The slovenian language does not need a lemmatizer, as the positive and negative lexicons are vast enough.
